    In this assessment, I tried to implement an exploratory testing as I didn't have
the required documentation for the application.

    First, I tested the application manually to be able to understand the functionalities
and behavior of it. I encountered various defects which are reported inside the
"Test Strategy - Test Plan" Excel document together with the screenshots.

    Then I created my Cucumber Framework based on Page Object Model. I put all locators inside the Pages
classes. I wrote all my test cases in Gherkin Language inside the files in the "features folder".
Then I created step definitions and implemented my codes.

    I created only 3 tests. I did not automate every field in the form application. I tested manually all fields.
There could have been many more tests to automate for it, but as the assessment asked for 2 tests, I added one more.

    I was able to locate the necessary fields that were tested but the html code should have been more
specific with unique attributes to get a good locator. Some attributes are too long, or have dynamic values.

    I created also a public repository in GitHub and pushed my framework firstly. Then I created my own
branch and committed the changes from my local branch to the one in the remote, afterwards, I created a
pull request and merged my codes with the main branch codes.
