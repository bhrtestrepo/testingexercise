There are three feature files in the 'features' folder.

The test cases can be executed in 2 ways:
1. By clicking the green run icon in the feature files
2. By passing the tags inside Runner class

I got PASS from every test.
Actually, from the test on the portuguese page, I should have gotten FAIL
as there is no success message, but appears an error message, so I asserted
the main header and got a PASS from the test. I reported the error message as a defect.
